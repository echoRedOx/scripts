# echoScripts

This is a small collection of bash scripts that I use for config and other useful stuff. My goal is to make configuring systems and envs as painless and reproducible as possible. 

**Watcher** is a useful script if you like real-time exec monitoring to read tracebacks for debug.
**OllamaEnv** helps setup an environment conducive to local ai chat and development using Ollama (obviously..) and PyEnv with virtualenv.
